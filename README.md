## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### State Management
- **React Context API**: Global state management for authentication, tasks, and theme
- **Custom Hooks**: Encapsulated business logic and API interactions
- **Local State**: Component-specific state for forms and UI interactions

### Data Flow
1. **Authentication**: JWT tokens stored in localStorage with automatic validation
2. **Task Operations**: CRUD operations through context providers
3. **Real-time Updates**: Immediate UI updates with optimistic rendering
4. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error states and user feedback

### Responsive Design
- Mobile-first approach with Tailwind CSS
- Breakpoints: 640px (sm), 768px (md), 1024px (lg)
- Flexible grid layouts and adaptive navigation
- Touch-friendly interactions on mobile devices

## 🚀 Deployment Architecture

This application is designed for modern deployment platforms:

### Frontend (Recommended: Vercel)
- Build command: `npm run build`
- Output directory: `dist`
- Environment variables for API endpoints

### Backend (Recommended: Railway/Heroku)
- Node.js/Express server
- MongoDB database integration
- JWT authentication middleware
- CORS configuration for frontend domain

### Database (Recommended: MongoDB Atlas)
- User collection with authentication data
- Tasks collection with user relationships
- Indexes for efficient querying
- Connection pooling and security

## 🔒 Security Features

- **JWT Authentication**: Secure token-based authentication
- **Password Hashing**: bcrypt for password security (simulated)
- **Route Protection**: Middleware for protected endpoints
- **Input Validation**: Client and server-side validation
- **XSS Protection**: Sanitized user inputs
- **CORS Configuration**: Proper cross-origin resource sharing

## 🎨 Design System

### Color Palette
- **Primary**: Blue (#3B82F6) for main actions and branding
- **Success**: Green (#10B981) for completed states
- **Warning**: Yellow (#F59E0B) for medium priority
- **Error**: Red (#EF4444) for high priority and errors
- **Neutral**: Gray scale for text and backgrounds

### Typography
- **Font Family**: System fonts with fallbacks
- **Headings**: 120% line height, semibold weight
- **Body Text**: 150% line height, regular weight
- **Small Text**: 140% line height for better readability

### Spacing System
- **Base Unit**: 8px spacing system
- **Consistent Margins**: 4, 8, 16, 24, 32px increments
- **Grid System**: Responsive flex and grid layouts

## 🔄 State Management Patterns

### Authentication Flow
```typescript
Login → JWT Token → localStorage → Context State → Protected Routes
```

### Task Management Flow
```typescript
User Action → Context Method → API Call → State Update → UI Rerender
```

### Theme Management Flow
```typescript
Toggle → Context State → localStorage → CSS Classes → Visual Update
```
